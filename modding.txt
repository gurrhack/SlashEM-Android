SLASH'EM Extended is open source, and as long as you adhere to the Nethack General Public License found in the "license" file, you are free to share it with others. You are also allowed to make your own modifications to it, and publish them as long as you also make the source code available. But if you do, please give your variant a distinctive name; call it "SLASH'EM Dextered" or whatever! Because I don't want other games floating around that call themselves SLASH'EM Extended when they're not the original. So, if you make a variant, change the name so that everyone knows they're playing a variant of my variant. Thank you!

*IMPORTANT NOTICE*: If I, Amy "Bluescreenofdeath", are to ever pass away, my will is that no further changes are made to the core SLEX variant, no matter how tiny; fixes for obvious segfaults and crash bugs are the only exception and even then only as long as no gameplay changes are made. If you make any other changes at all, *PLEASE* release them as your own variant and under a different name (you could call your variant SLOX or whatever floats your mind). I know that if I'm dead (which hopefully won't happen anytime soon), I won't be able to object anymore if some jerk does indeed, say, remove all the nasty traps from SLEX and then releases it as a new version of SLEX, but rest assured that I'll be turning over in my grave and my ghost will haunt you for all eternity :P
Addendum: This *especially* applies to any people who happen to be official members of the SLEX devteam after my demise. If you make changes, release them as your own fork of SLEX and leave my original game alone, please!

Feel free to contact me on the #em.slashem.me or #hardfought IRC channels on Freenode, my nick is usually "LarienTelrunya" but may also be "AmyBSOD" or variations thereof. Have fun, and remember, if you add interesting things to your variant, I might pull them into SLEX and give you credit :)
